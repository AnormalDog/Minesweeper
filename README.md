# MINESWEEPER

Simple minesweeper in c++ done in a boring night, just for practise.  
My first project in github and using git too  
Was made in and for linux  
For compile just g++ main.cc

# USAGE
it use mf fields (why mf? becuase MineField and sounds cool) text files  
First two numbers are the rows and columns respectively  
Rest of numbers are:  
  0 = empty  
  1 = bomb  

Example:  
3 3  
0 0 0  
1 0 0  
0 0 0  
(also works in a single row everything)
# ERROR CODES

1 = was used a invalid number of arguments (only is needed one argument, the mf name)  
2 = error opening the file
